# Global Trends in Forced Displacement A 50 Year Analysis

This project aims to analyze the UNHCR dataset on forcibly displaced populations to understand global migration and refugee trends over a 50-year period. I will leverage SQL for data preprocessing and analysis and Power BI for creating data visualizations and insights. Through the lens of SQL and PowerBI, I aim to uncover insightful patterns, explore demographic trends, and assess the causes and consequences of refugee movements across the world. The project will culminate in the creation of interactive maps and visualizations, providing a comprehensive understanding of this humanitarian challenge.

## Project Impact
This project aims to shed light on one of the world's most pressing humanitarian challenges. By analyzing the UNHCR Refugee Dataset and creating impactful visualizations, we seek to raise awareness about the causes and consequences of refugee crises, inform policymakers, and support organizations dedicated to addressing this issue. Ultimately, the project contributes to a better understanding of the global refugee landscape, with the potential to drive informed decisions and solutions for those affected by displacement.


## Data Acquisition and Exploration:

The dataset used in this analysis is the UNHCR dataset on forcibly displaced populations from the official United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) website. This dataset is current and was last updated on 14 June 2023 as of the date and time of itâ€™s download, 20/09/2023 22:18 UTC. Some data presented may differ from statistics published previously due to retroactive changes or the inclusion of previously unavailable data.	The data table contains the following:	

- Population figures
- Content type:	End-year stock population totals
- Data quick link	https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=xXst2S
- Data definitions: https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/methodology/
- Usage license:	https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
- Population types included: REF, ROC, ASY, IDP, IOC, OIP, OOC, STA
- Years:	1972-2022
- Countries: All countries of asylum and all countries of origin.

I began by exploring the UNHCR Refugee Dataset to understand its structure, variables, and the breadth of data available for analysis. The following was observed

```{sql}
SELECT * FROM `unhcr displacement`;
```


##  Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:

I create a SQL database, in My SQL to store the dataset. I proceeded to load the dataset into the database. I performed Perform data cleaning, including handling missing values and duplicates.

_**Check Structure and datatypes of dataset**_

```{sql}
DESCRIBE `unhcr displacement`;
```

_**Replacing "-" in the `Other people in need of international protection` column with int values**_

```{sql}
UPDATE `unhcr displacement`
SET `Other people in need of international protection` = 0
WHERE `Other people in need of international protection` = "-";
```

_**Changing Data Type**_

```{sql}
ALTER TABLE `unhcr displacement`
MODIFY COLUMN `Other people in need of international protection` int;
```

## Data Analysis
For data cleaning, transformation, and initial querying of the UNHCR Refugee Dataset, I used SQL. I proceeded to use PowerBI to create interactive maps, dashboards, and visualizations that convey the project's insights effectively. Here are the questions I explored with this dataset:

### Trends in Global Forced Displacement
1. What is the total number of forcibly displaced people in the last 50 years?
2. Has the total number of displaced people increased or decreased over the years?
3. How has the total number of refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons (IDPs) changed over the years?
4. Which year had the highest and lowest total number of people displaced?

### Geospatial Analysis 
5. Which countries have been major sources of refugees, and which have been major host countries?
6. Have there been significant changes in the leading countries of origin and asylum over time?
7. Are there any countries that have consistently received refugees and asylum seekers while also being major sources of displacement themselves?


### Comparative Analysis and Impact of Events
8. Are there any countries where asylum seekers significantly outnumber refugees?
9. In which year did each country have the highest number of displaced people?
10. Are there specific global events, conflicts, or crises that correlate with significant changes in refugee movements or demographics?

### Other People in Need of International Protection
11. Are there specific years or periods where other people in need of international protection experienced significant increases or decreases?
12. Are there countries or regions where the proportion of "Other People in Need of International Protection" is significantly higher or lower compared to refugees and asylum seekers?

### Predictive Modeling
13. Can you build predictive models to forecast future trends in refugee movements or asylum applications based on historical data?
